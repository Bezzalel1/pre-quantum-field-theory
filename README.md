# Pre Quantum Field Theory (PQF)

This repository contains the full Lagrangian and falsifiable predictions of the **Pre Quantum Field (PQF) Theory**, a unified scalar field model that proposes matter, quantum behavior, curvature, and cosmic structure all emerge from a single coherent-decoherent vacuum field.

## 📜 The PQF Lagrangian

L_PQF = -½ (∂_μ φ)^2 - ρ₀ e^(−φ/φₛ) - (κ/2)(∇ × ∇φ)^2 + λ₀(1 - e^(−φ/φₛ)) φ ρ̂(x)

where  
- φ(x) is the Pre Quantum Field  
- ρ̂(x) = ξ[(1/2)(∂_μ φ)^2 + V(φ)] is the emergent matter density  
- V(φ) = ρ₀ e^(−φ/φₛ) is the field potential  
- κ is the vortex coupling constant  
- λ₀ is the matter–field coupling strength

## ✅ Falsifiable Predictions (Testable Now)

Each of the following predictions arises directly from the PQF Lagrangian, not as add-ons or postulates. All are testable with current technology and supported by included simulations.

1. **Vacuum-Origin Star Formation**  
   Stars emerge from field decoherence, not classical gas collapse.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

2. **Intrinsic Stellar Fuel**  
   Stars form with built-in energy from vacuum condensation — not by accreting fuel.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

3. **No White Holes**  
   PQF predicts black holes recycle matter via phase transitions; white holes cannot exist.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

4. **8–10% Gravitational Lensing Excess**  
   PQF field gradients generate additional curvature — matching observed lensing anomalies.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

5. **Ring-Structured Planet Formation**  
   Vortex terms naturally form stable ring gaps and planets — no need for seed masses.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

6. **Logarithmic Orbital Spacing**  
   Planetary distances emerge with a logarithmic distribution.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

7. **Gravitational Wave Ringdown Delay**  
   PQF predicts a ~16.67 min delay in lensing response after wave events.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

8. **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves**  
   Vortex energy replaces dark matter to support flat velocity profiles.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

9. **Tully–Fisher Scaling Recovery**  
   PQF reproduces the luminosity–velocity scaling law via vortex dynamics.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

10. **Bullet Cluster Offset Prediction**  
    Time-dependent vortex term accounts for observed baryon–potential separation.  
    🔬 *Simulation included*
