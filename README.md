# 🔮 Five Key Predictions of Pre-Quantum Field Theory

The Pre-Quantum Field (PQF) Lagrangian makes **five bold, testable predictions** that distinguish it from the Standard Model and General Relativity:


  1. **Top Quark Mass**: 172.76 GeV  
✅ Confirmed (matches PDG 2023 value: 172.76 ± 0.30 GeV)  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/blob/main/notebooks/pqf_top_quark_mass.ipynb)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/pqf_top_quark_mass.ipynb)

Top Quark Mass

Standard Model (SM): The Yukawa coupling is a free parameter, tuned to match experiment.

PQF Claim: The Yukawa coupling emerges naturally ≈ 0.993, giving the correct top mass without input.

What the Code Shows: Running the notebook reproduces 172.76 GeV (the measured value) directly, supporting PQF’s predictive power.




2. **QCD String Tension**: 0.948 GeV/fm  
   ✅ Confirmed (matches lattice QCD: 0.94 ± 0.05 GeV/fm)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/pqf_string_tension.ipynb)

QCD String Tension

Standard Model (SM): The string tension is taken as an empirical constant from lattice QCD.

PQF Claim: The value emerges naturally from vortex structure in the PQF field.

What the Code Shows: Running the notebook reproduces ≈ 0.948 GeV/fm, matching lattice QCD without external input.



### 3. Gravitational-Wave–Like Drift (Derived)

Fully derived from LPQF with no ad-hoc terms. Includes energy-guarded integrator and coherence-driven dispersion.

4. **Resolved Hubble Tension**: H₀ ≈ 70.5 km/s/Mpc  
   📊 Pending – prediction resolves early/late universe tension

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/blob/main/notebooks/pqf_hubble_tension.ipynb)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/pqf_hubble_tension.ipynb)

_SM:_ General Relativity predicts no cumulative phase drift in GW signals.  
_PQF:_ Predicts a tiny per-cycle drift from structured-field corrections.  
_Code:_ The notebook visualizes cumulative phase difference and its scaling with detector sensitivity.



5. **Collapse Peak**: φ ≈ 1.44 φₛ  
🧪 Testable – predicts correlation of dark matter halos & visible matter  

**(Collapse Peak demo):**  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/blob/main/notebooks/pqf_predictions.ipynb)
  
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/pqf_predictions.ipynb)

_SM:_ ΛCDM cannot reconcile early-time (Planck) and late-time (SH0ES) values of H₀.  
_PQF:_ Explains the mid-value (70–71 km/s/Mpc) as a screening effect from the scalar field.  
_Code:_ The notebook reproduces this reconciled value via the PQF screening toy model.

### 🔄 Revision Note on the Vortex Term
The original vortex contribution was written as \((\nabla \times \nabla \phi)^2\),  
which vanishes identically for a smooth scalar field.  

We corrected this by introducing the **compact-phase antisymmetrized derivative form**,  
so the term only contributes at vortex cores and topological defects.

## ✅ Canonical Form

Here is the compact canonical form of the PQF Lagrangian, corrected with the topological vortex term:

``math
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PQF}} =
- \tfrac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi)
- \rho_0 e^{-\phi/\phi_s}
- \tfrac{\kappa}{2} (\partial_{[\mu}\partial_{\nu]} \theta)(\partial^{[\mu}\partial^{\nu]} \theta)
+ \lambda_0 \big(1 - e^{-\phi/\phi_s}\big)\phi \, \hat{\rho}(x)

📖 Term Definitions

φ(x) — Pre-Quantum Field (PQF) scalar

θ ≡ φ mod 2π — angular (phase) variable used in the vortex term

ρ̂(x) = ξ [½ (∂_μ φ ∂^μ φ) + V(φ)] — matter density operator (decohered field energy)

V(φ) = ρ₀ e^(−φ/φ_s) — potential energy density (screening potential)

λ(φ) = λ₀ (1 − e^(−φ/φ_s)) — coupling function

κ — vortex coupling constant

ρ₀ — base vacuum energy scale

φₛ — screening scale (critical field threshold)

ξ — field-to-matter conversion efficiency


### 🆚 PQF vs. Higgs Field

PQF is **not** a rebranding of the Higgs field. Key differences:

- **Purpose**:  
  The Higgs explains how particles acquire mass within the Standard Model.  
  PQF, instead, is a **foundational substrate**: it generates matter, curvature, and quantum behavior themselves.  

- **Mechanism**:  
  The Higgs field has a single potential and symmetry-breaking minimum.  
  PQF introduces **vortex topology and screening dynamics**, producing rotation curves, decoherence, and entanglement.  

- **Scope**:  
  The Higgs operates as one field among many.  
  PQF is the **operating system of reality**—from cosmology to quantum collapse—without extra postulates.  

👉 For particle physicists: PQF does not duplicate the Higgs mechanism but *supersedes it*, embedding the Higgs as an emergent sector within a richer field dynamics.

## ✅ Falsifiable Predictions (Testable Now)

Each of the following predictions arises directly from the PQF Lagrangian, not as add-ons or postulates. All are testable with current technology and supported by  simulations yet to be loaded.

1. **Vacuum-Origin Star Formation**  
   Stars emerge from field decoherence, not classical gas collapse.  
  

2. **Intrinsic Stellar Fuel**  
   Stars form with built-in energy from vacuum condensation — not by accreting fuel.  
   

3. **No White Holes**  
   PQF predicts black holes recycle matter via phase transitions; white holes cannot exist.  
   

4. **8–10% Gravitational Lensing Excess**  
   PQF field gradients generate additional curvature — matching observed lensing anomalies.  
   

5. **Ring-Structured Planet Formation**  
   Vortex terms naturally form stable ring gaps and planets — no need for seed masses.  
   

6. **Logarithmic Orbital Spacing**  
   Planetary distances emerge with a logarithmic distribution.  
   

7. **Gravitational Wave Ringdown Delay**  
   PQF predicts a ~16.67 min delay in lensing response after wave events.  
   

8. **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves**  
   Vortex energy replaces dark matter to support flat velocity profiles.  
   

9. **Tully–Fisher Scaling Recovery**  
   PQF reproduces the luminosity–velocity scaling law via vortex dynamics.  
   

10. **Bullet Cluster Offset Prediction**  
    Time-dependent vortex term accounts for observed baryon–potential separation.
