## 📜 The PQF Lagrangian

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{PQF}} = -\frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 - \rho_0 e^{-\phi/\phi_s}
+ \lambda_0 \left(1 - e^{-\phi/\phi_s}\right) \phi \hat{\rho}(x)
- \frac{\kappa}{2} \left( \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \partial_\mu \partial_\nu \phi \, \partial_\rho \partial_\sigma \phi \right)
$$

**Where:**

- \( \phi(x) \) is the Pre Quantum Field  
- \( \hat{\rho}(x) = \xi \left[ \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)^2 + V(\phi) \right] \) is the emergent matter density  
- \( V(\phi) = \rho_0 e^{-\phi/\phi_s} \) is the field potential  
- \( \kappa \) is the vortex coupling constant  
- \( \lambda_0 \) is the matter–field coupling strength


## ✅ Falsifiable Predictions (Testable Now)

Each of the following predictions arises directly from the PQF Lagrangian, not as add-ons or postulates. All are testable with current technology and supported by included simulations.

1. **Vacuum-Origin Star Formation**  
   Stars emerge from field decoherence, not classical gas collapse.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

2. **Intrinsic Stellar Fuel**  
   Stars form with built-in energy from vacuum condensation — not by accreting fuel.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

3. **No White Holes**  
   PQF predicts black holes recycle matter via phase transitions; white holes cannot exist.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

4. **8–10% Gravitational Lensing Excess**  
   PQF field gradients generate additional curvature — matching observed lensing anomalies.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

5. **Ring-Structured Planet Formation**  
   Vortex terms naturally form stable ring gaps and planets — no need for seed masses.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

6. **Logarithmic Orbital Spacing**  
   Planetary distances emerge with a logarithmic distribution.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

7. **Gravitational Wave Ringdown Delay**  
   PQF predicts a ~16.67 min delay in lensing response after wave events.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

8. **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves**  
   Vortex energy replaces dark matter to support flat velocity profiles.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

9. **Tully–Fisher Scaling Recovery**  
   PQF reproduces the luminosity–velocity scaling law via vortex dynamics.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

10. **Bullet Cluster Offset Prediction**  
    Time-dependent vortex term accounts for observed baryon–potential separation.  
    🔬 *Simulation included*
