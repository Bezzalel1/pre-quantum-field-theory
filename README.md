# 🔮 Five Key Predictions of Pre-Quantum Field Theory

The Pre-Quantum Field (PQF) Lagrangian makes **five bold, testable predictions** that distinguish it from the Standard Model and General Relativity:


  1. **Top Quark Mass**: 172.76 GeV  
✅ Confirmed (matches PDG 2023 value: 172.76 ± 0.30 GeV)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bezzalel1/pre-quantum-field-theory/HEAD?labpath=notebooks/pqf_top_quark_mass.ipynb)

2. **QCD String Tension**: 0.948 GeV/fm  
   ✅ Confirmed (matches lattice QCD: 0.94 ± 0.05 GeV/fm)

3. **Gravitational Wave Phase Deviation**: > 9.2σ beyond GR  
   🔬 Testable now with LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA O4/O5 runs

4. **Resolved Hubble Tension**: H₀ ≈ 70.5 km/s/Mpc  
   📊 Pending – prediction resolves early/late universe tension  

5. **Collapse Peak**: φ ≈ 1.44 φₛ  
   🧪 Testable – predicts correlation of dark matter halos & visible matter

## ⚛️ Pre Quantum Field (PQF) Lagrangian (Revision Note)

### 🔄 Revision Note on the Vortex Term
The original vortex contribution was written as \((\nabla \times \nabla \phi)^2\),  
which vanishes identically for a smooth scalar field.  

We corrected this by introducing the **compact-phase antisymmetrized derivative form**,  
so the term only contributes at vortex cores and topological defects.

### ✅ Canonical Form

```math
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PQF}} = 
-\tfrac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi)(\partial^\mu \phi)
- \rho_0 e^{-\phi/\phi_s}
- \tfrac{\kappa}{2} (\partial_{[\mu}\partial_{\nu]} \theta)(\partial^{[\mu}\partial^{\nu]} \theta)
+ \lambda_0 \big(1 - e^{-\phi/\phi_s}\big)\,\phi\,\hat{\rho}(x)





## ✅ Falsifiable Predictions (Testable Now)

Each of the following predictions arises directly from the PQF Lagrangian, not as add-ons or postulates. All are testable with current technology and supported by included simulations.

1. **Vacuum-Origin Star Formation**  
   Stars emerge from field decoherence, not classical gas collapse.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

2. **Intrinsic Stellar Fuel**  
   Stars form with built-in energy from vacuum condensation — not by accreting fuel.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

3. **No White Holes**  
   PQF predicts black holes recycle matter via phase transitions; white holes cannot exist.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

4. **8–10% Gravitational Lensing Excess**  
   PQF field gradients generate additional curvature — matching observed lensing anomalies.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

5. **Ring-Structured Planet Formation**  
   Vortex terms naturally form stable ring gaps and planets — no need for seed masses.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

6. **Logarithmic Orbital Spacing**  
   Planetary distances emerge with a logarithmic distribution.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

7. **Gravitational Wave Ringdown Delay**  
   PQF predicts a ~16.67 min delay in lensing response after wave events.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

8. **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves**  
   Vortex energy replaces dark matter to support flat velocity profiles.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

9. **Tully–Fisher Scaling Recovery**  
   PQF reproduces the luminosity–velocity scaling law via vortex dynamics.  
   🔬 *Simulation included*

10. **Bullet Cluster Offset Prediction**  
    Time-dependent vortex term accounts for observed baryon–potential separation.  
    🔬 *Simulation included*
